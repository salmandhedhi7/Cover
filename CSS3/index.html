<h1>Inheritance</h1>
<p>
    Unicode has the explicit aim of transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings, such as those
     defined by 
    the ISO/IEC 8859 standard, which find wide usage in various countries of th
    e world but remain largely incompatible with
     each other. Many traditional character encodings share a common problem in that they allow bilingual computer
      processing (usually using
      Latin characters and the local script), but not multilingual computer processing (computer 
     processing of arbitrary scripts mixed with each other).</p>

     <h1>Head 2</h1>

<p>Unicode, in intent, encodes the underlying characters—graphemes and grapheme-like units—rather than the variant glyphs 
(renderings) for such characters. In the case of Chinese characters, this sometimes leads to controversies over
 distinguishing the underlying character from its variant glyphs (see Han unification).</p>

 <h1>Head 3</h1>

<p> Text processing, Unicode takes the role of providing a unique code point—a number, not a glyph—for each character. 
In other words, Unicode represents a character in an abstract way and leaves the visual rendering
 (size, shape, font, or style) to other software, such as a web browser or word processor. This simple aim becomes
  complicated, however, because 
 of concessions made by Unicode's designers in the hope of encouraging a more rapid adoption of Unicode.</p>
<h1>Head 4</h1>
<p>The first 256 code points were made identical to the content of ISO/IEC 8859-1 so as to make it trivial to convert
 existing
 western text. Many essentially identical characters were encoded multiple times at different code points to preserve
 distinctions used by legacy encodings and therefore, allow conversion from those encodings to 
 Unicode (and back) without lossing any 
   information. For example, the "fullwidth forms" section of code points encompasses a full duplicate 
  of the Latin alphabet because Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) fonts
   contain two versions of these letters, "fullwidth" matching the width of 
  the CJK characters, and normal width. For other examples, see duplicate characters in Unicode.</p>
